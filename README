Command for encrypting: java AES e -length 128/256 keyFile inputFile
Command for decryption: java AES d -length 128/256 keyFile encryptedinputFile
Default command for 128-bit ECB: java AES e/d keyFile inputFile <= Defaults to AES-128

NOTE: 128/256 means either 128 or 256. e/d means either e or d.

We also have another source file called MCTables.java that uses look up tables for the mixColumns multiplication.

In addition to implementing AES-256, we also modified our program to implement AES-128. Using the -length argument, it can be determined whether the program will run AES-256 or 128. If the -length argument is not mentioned, then it will run AES-128 by default. Also, the program will print an error if a user tries to run AES-256 using a 128-bit key, and vice versa.
